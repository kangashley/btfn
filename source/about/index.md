__COiL__ is a collective of organizers who are deeply committed to ending “cemscawship” (capitalist, eco-murdering, settler colonial, ableist, white supremacist, imperialist heteropatriarchy) and working towards a just world in which people can flourish as full human beings. We  support, love and hold each other; we learn, strategize and act together.  For COiL, a commitment to ending “cemscawship” means participating in grassroots movement building and building our capacity for collective thinking, studying and practice that reflects the world we want to live in.

__Another Politics is Possible (APP)__ is a group of organizers and activists in New York City. Their core values include collective leadership, democratic self-determination, challenging all systems of oppression, and centering the experiences of people most targeted by these intersecting systems.
