<h2>Paris Commune</h2>

In 1871, Parisians rose up against France’s national government to establish an independent commune. The Communards organized local self-government, neighborhood assemblies and workers’ councils to redistribute wealth, manage workplaces, and much more, including the hundreds who worked to create collective childcare spaces so that women could participate fully in decision-making and other aspects of public and political life.
