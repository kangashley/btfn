<h2>What We Value and Envision</h2>

<h3>Creativity</h3>

We have seen how joyful, transformative and humanizing it is to unleash creativity. We believe it is a necessary and integral part of revolutionary practice and process.

<h3>Collective Care</h3>

"These are the times to grow our souls. Each of us is called upon to embrace the conviction that despite the powers and principalities bent on commodifying all our human relationships, we have the power within us to create the world anew."
–Grace Lee Boggs

We teach ourselves how to have ethical relationships, developing the practices and models that help us to create and sustain them. We center supporting each other in building our resilience, processing the traumas we experience and stopping cycles of violence. We forge new social relations that are non- capitalist, that recognize strength in difference and build our capacity to hold that difference.

<h3>Cultivation of Mind/Body/Spirit</h3>

We learn to embrace ourselves in our wholeness. Education and healthcare are integrated into our everyday lives and based on skills and knowledge which allow for us to develop the ability to constantly learn, grow and maintain our health as our bodies change and our environment and needs change. We support curiosity in children, and in ourselves, by sharing a respectful, participatory, playful, and loving way of life.

<h3>Shared Work, Responsibility and Solidarity</h3>

Prioritizing creativity supports a meaningful relationship to the ‘wholeness’ of our labor. We seek to build an economy that provides for our basic needs, and that is constructed in relationship and in communication with the desires of everyone who will utilize and benefit from what is created. Time dedicated even to work for basic needs can be joyful and meaningful when connected to our relationships, collective lives and the well-being of our communities.

<h3>Living in Harmony with the Earth</h3>

Defending, sustaining and restoring the Earth are essential if humanity is to have a future. Many of us are in the process of recreating a mutually sustaining relationship to the rest of the living and non-living world. Societies that have survived and lived for thousands of years with this balance are showing us the way. This conception is central to many of the indigenous, urban and campesino movements now transforming América and the world–from the water wars of Bolivia and today’s growing climate justice movement to the tens of millions of campesinos who united across the planet in La Via Campesina to defend the land we live and work on from the giant agribusiness corporations.

<h3>Sympathetic and Mutually Beneficial Global Ties</h3>

We can share resources and distribute and build in ways that are mutually beneficial across all land masses and transcend the oppressive borders of the nation-state.

<h3>Another World Based on Solidarity, Autonomy, Equity, Difference and Self-Management</h3>

The past and present are full of examples of the possibility of another world. Some are small, others extend to whole towns and cities; some span months and others years and decades. From the Haudenosaunee or Six Nations Confederacy from whom Ben Franklin and the Framers of the U. S. Constitution found inspiration and the Seattle General Strike of 1919, which organized the city under worker-control, to today’s autonomous communities throughout Mexico from Maclovia Rojas just across the border of California in Tijuana down to the Zapatistas’ Councils of Good Government and Caracoles in Chiapas, and as far South as Argentina’s occupied factories sin patrones (without bosses). Another world is not only possible, but is under construction.
