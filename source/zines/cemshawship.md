A few years ago we got sick of both using “capitalism” as shorthand for our understanding of intersecting oppressions and systems AND we got tired of listing out said oppressions and systems.  So we made up an acronym!

Cemscawship stands for __c__apitalist, __e__co-__m__urdering, __s__ettler-__c__olonial, __a__bleist, __w__hite __s__upremacist, __h__etero __p__atriarchy.

We know it’s awkward and yet, we keep using it.
