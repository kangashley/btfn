<h2>A Clear Vision Means We Do Our Work Differently</h2>

The vision laid out [here](/zines/what-we-value-and-envision) is, of course, not comprehensive, but gives hints of the elements of the different kind of world that we can build together. Keeping this vision in mind while we organize, practice and reflect means that in our political work today we are planting the seeds of the future society for which we are striving. Some people call this prefigurative politics. The way we organize our resistance, practice leadership and build power now are the kernels of the society we are creating. The most central things we think will help us hold pre-figurative politics are a) Putting into practice the lessons of intersectionality and b) striving toward non-hierarchy and collective leadership and care in our relationships, organizations and movements.
