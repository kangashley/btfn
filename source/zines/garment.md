<h2>Garment Workers Center</h2>

The grassroots work done at the Garment Worker Center is centered on workers and their workplace issues, Yet, when we didn’t give room to create a location for full rich- ness of emotional feelings for men, we saw and heard from families that the men who were members were abusing alcohol, carry- ing out emotional violence and control of their families. It meant their involvement with the organization was re-enforcing patriarchal vi- olence at home and a re-enforcement of what is considered ‘masculine’ or ‘tough’ behavior. Whereas, when we made room within for men to discuss their emotions beyond anger and when we discussed workplace oppres- sion and how it triggered issues around their own experiences of abuse as children, many of the men were able to participate more con- sistently in meetings and able to obtain deep- er involvement and support of their families.
