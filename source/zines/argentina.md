<h2>2001 Economic Collapse in Argentina</h2>

In December of 2001 the economy of Argentina collapsed and a general reaction against the banks and the government that supported them began. There was the rejec- tion of the political sectors, against financial power and against judicial power. Out of this came the building of new social relations partly through the take-over of factories, res- taurants, and hotels and use of these for the
needs of people.

The book Horizontalism: Voices of Popular Power in Argentina interviews people about their experiences:

Neka from the MTD Solano reflects: "For example, with me, it wasn’t that I was at all machista before, but it was assumed that the woman in a relationship would wash the dish- es, or cook and serve, and clean the clothes. But now there are changes in this, and we’re more conscious of these sorts of dynamics. I believe we’re taking steps forward. Before, if a couple was in the movement, it was the woman who stayed home with the children while the man went out into the streets. There has been a change in this—now there are both compañeros and compañeras who look after all the children. I believe this is a real transformation. We talk a lot about all of this and feel we are collectively taking charge of our history, doing so in solidarity with one another. Another thing that is dis- cussed a lot is that we see the children as all of ours, and not so much belonging to anyone; they’re all of our responsibilities. Before we came to these sorts of conclusions, if a baby was fussing in meetings, someone would say, "Take care of your child." But now, whoever is closest and most able helps the child."
